# Digital Counter on Proteus

Welcome to the Digital Counter project implemented in Proteus. This project demonstrates a simple digital counter designed and simulated using Proteus. The project includes a .pdsprj file, which contains the complete design and simulation setup for the digital counter.

## Project Overview

The digital counter is an essential electronic circuit used to count pulses and display the count value. This implementation demonstrates the following features:

- **Incrementing Counter**: The counter increments its value with each pulse.
- **Display**: The current count value is displayed on a 7-segment display.

## Proteus Simulation

The Proteus .pdsprj file includes the following components:

- **Pulse Generator**: Generates the input pulses for the counter.
- **Counter IC**: The integrated circuit responsible for counting the pulses.
- **7-Segment Display**: Displays the current count value.

## Usage

1. **Install Proteus**: Ensure that you have Proteus installed on your system.
2. **Open the Project**: Open the provided .pdsprj file in Proteus.
3. **Run the Simulation**: Start the simulation to observe the counter in action. The 7-segment display will show the count value as it increments with each input pulse.
